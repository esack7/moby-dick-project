This Project takes the ```.txt``` file of Herman Melville's book Moby Dick and parses the file to determine the top 100 most used words along with the count of the usages of each.  The logic of processing the ```.txt``` file occurs pre Webpack build utilizing Node.js and produces a ```.json``` file that the React font end uses to display the results.
